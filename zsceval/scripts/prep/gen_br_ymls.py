"""One best-response training yml per held-out partner.

The denominator of BR-Prox should be the best response to a partner -- an agent
trained specifically to work with it. `analyze_crossplay.py` currently
approximates that with the best score any agent *already in the pool* achieved
against that partner, which is biased low: nothing in the pool was trained to
exploit anyone. Every number built on it is optimistic in the same direction --
BR-Prox overstates how much of the achievable return a method captures, regret
understates the shortfall, and CVaR understates the worst case.

The proxy also misleads about the *partner*, which is how it produced a wrong
conclusion here. On random3 thirteen of sixteen partners had `br_hat` 0, read
at the time as "the layout has no headroom". It means only that nothing in our
pool scored with them: pairing hsp12 with the `w1` partner it trained beside
returns 180.0, and `w1` is never in the cross-play pool because
`gen_crossplay_yml.py` references only `w0`. True headroom on that layout is
large and every method captures approximately none of it -- a far stronger
statement than the one the proxy supported.

Upstream's `gen_train_br_ymls.py` reads a `benchmarks-s{2K}.yml` produced by
the bias-agent selection flow this project replaced with
`prep/select_hsp_seeds.py`, so it cannot run against this pool. This writes the
same thing from the checkpoints that are actually present.

Each yml holds the trainable `br_agent` and exactly one frozen partner, which
is what `--population_size 1 --adaptive_agent_name br_agent` expects.
